A platform to learn African writing systems.

Background
---

Africa is home to several writing systems. However, most of these systems are primarily used by linguists and are not widely adopted by the general population. Today, many Africans rely on English or French spellings to express native sounds in writing.

While Input Method Engines (IMEs) exist to facilitate typing in these scripts, they assume prior knowledge of the writing system. But how can someone use an IME if they haven't learned the script?

Through this project, we aim to make African writing systems more accessible by helping users learn not only the scripts themselves, but also their alphabets and pronunciations.
